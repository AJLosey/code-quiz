# code-quiz

description:
This is a project to create a small quiz. The goal was that clicking on right answers moves you to the next question, and that wrong answers penalize your time. At the end, the user's score would be stored. No CSS styling was expressely required for this project, and I wanted to see if I could avoid creating a CSS document entirely.
